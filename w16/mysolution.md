I can write another if statement for washing clothes or dishes more than 9 times a week and make it equal to 3 points. 

if running it 4 to 9 times a week then add 2 points

if running it 1 to 3 times a week then add 1 point

or else 0 
-----

if user owns a dishwasher and washing machine then total * 2 or run the same logic twice
