Yes, I did understand functions and how to get the return value as a result. I had forgot a little bit about how to use the return value outside of the function, so that was a good refresher and I understand it better now.

I've learned the spread function and IIFE functions. Spread functions can use multiple arguments and IIFE are immediately executed functions.
